## Important

1.  If you're implement upon it, make sure to create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
STRIPE_PRIVATE_KEY=api_key
STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET=webhook_secret
STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_PRODUCT=product_id
MONGO_URI=mongodb
ADMIN_EMAIL=
JWT_SECRET=keyboard_cat
HOST=http://localhost:1337
```

2.  Create a stripe product with different prices for different subscription duration.
    *   You can also add multiple products but that will require some extra work. Let me know if you need this.

3.  Before accessing custoner portal via `/api/subscription/portal`, you need to configure your stripe customer portal settings: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
